                <h1>Q&A ‚Äì What Patients Usually Ask</h1>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Are There Different Techniques of Acupuncture?</h2>
                <p>Acupuncture originated in China. In recent years it has spread to Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Europe, the British Isles, the United States and other parts of the world. As such, there are a variety of styles developed and practiced based on differing opinions as to the theory and technique.</p>
                <p>Patients should talk to their practitioners about their particular style or school and learn as much as possible about the treatment being proposed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What Criteria Should One Use In Choosing an Acupuncturist?</h2>
                <p>Patients should ask where the acupuncturist or practitioner was trained, how long their training was for, how long he/she has been in practice, and what experience the acupuncturist has had in treating patients for a specific ailment.</p>
                <p>Acupuncture is a licensed and regulated healthcare profession in approximately half the states in the United States. In states that do not require licensing, patients should ask the acupuncturist if the National Commission has certified them for the Certification of Acupuncturist. Acupuncturists who have passed this exam are entitled to add Dipl. Ac. (Diplomat of Acupuncture) after their name.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How Many Treatments Will I Need?</h2>
                <p>Treatments vary according to the duration, severity, and nature of an ailment or complaint. An acute condition may only need one treatment. Chronic problems may be resolved in five to fifteen treatments. Some degenerative conditions may require additional treatments over a longer period of time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>How Many Treatments Are Necessary?</h2>
                <p>It is recommended that a series of 10 treatments be given. Many patients will obtain the best results after 6 or 12 treatments. It is best to consult with the acupuncturist on individual treatment. Treatments are preferably given twice a week in the beginning and then spread out as the patient improves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What Training Should Patients Look For?</h2>

            </div>
