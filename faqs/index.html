                <h2>Are There Different Techniques of Acupuncture?</h2>
                <p>Acupuncture originated in China. In recent years it has spread to Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Europe, the British Isles, the United States and other parts of the world. As such, there are a variety of styles developed and practiced based on differing opinions as to the theory and technique.</p>
