                    <h2>How Does Acupuncture Work?</h2>
                    <p>Traditional acupuncture is based on ancient Chinese theories of the flow of Qi (pronounced Chee) – energy and Xue (blood) through distinct meridians or pathways that cover the body somewhat like the way nerves and blood vessels do. According to ancient theory, acupuncture allows Qi to flow to areas where Qi is deficient and away from areas where Qi is excessive. It is in this manner, that acupuncture regulates and restores the harmonious energetic balance of the body.</p>
                    <blockquote>"There is no pain if there is free flow; if there is pain, there is no free flow." - Chinese saying</blockquote>
                
                    <h2>What is Acupuncture?</h2>
                    <p>Acupuncture is the practice of inserting fine needles at specific points into the body and has been shown through the centuries as an effective method of treatment for various health problems. These points have been revealed, studied, and mapped by the Chinese over thousands of years. Electromagnetic research has also confirmed these points.</p>
                
                    <h2>Common Questions About Acupuncture</h2>
                    
                    <h3>How Deep Do The Needles Go?</h3>
                    <p>The depth of insertion depends on several factors: the location of the points selected, the patient's size, age and condition, as well as, the acupuncturist's style or school. Needles are normally inserted 1/4 to 1 inch into the skin.</p>

                    <h3>Does It Hurt?</h3>
                    <p>In Chinese, acupuncture is bu tong – translated into English – painless. Some people may categorize the sensation as a form of pain, yet if any sensation or discomfort is experienced, it is usually mild. Patients might feel some mild cramping, heaviness, distention, tingling or electric sensations around the area where the needles have been inserted or traveling up or down the affected energy pathway (or Meridian).</p>

                    <h3>Are Needles Clean?</h3>
                    <p>Only sterilized, individually packaged, disposable needles are utilized. Needles are not saved and are not reused at a later date. This eliminates the possibility of transmitting diseases through the reuse of a potentially contaminated needle. Florida Law requires disposable Needles.</p>

                    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                    <p>Following an acupuncture treatment, patients experience a sense of well being, relaxation, and often energized. As a sign of obtaining the vital energy, some patients may experience a slight sensation of soreness, numbness, distention or heaviness around the needle area. Patients should be comfortable and relaxed during treatment to attain the desired results.</p>
                    <p>The reaction usually starts during the first four or five visits. As with any other medical treatment, not all cases can be cured. However, there is no harmful effect from the therapy in common practice. Therefore, patients who suffer from lingering or chronic diseases that haven't responded well to orthodox medicine intervention are particularly encouraged to try this promising Chinese art of healing.</p>

                    <h3>How Acupuncture Helps Support In-Vitro Fertilization</h3>
                    <p>If you are like many women, you have probably heard that acupuncture combined with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) can help increase the chance of a successful pregnancy. Many women are having great results utilizing acupuncture to complement the IVF cycle. A recent study found acupuncture improves pregnancy success rate by 50% in women undergoing IVF. So how does this 3,000-year-old medicine actually help support IVF?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fertility-tcm">
                    <h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Approach</h3>
                    <p>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, disease and malfunction in the body result from a blockage in the flow of vital Qi (energy) and Blood. By removing these blockages and restoring a smooth normal flow, the body is able to restore health and optimum organ function. Through the use of hair-thin needles and Chinese herbs, Acupuncture Physicians are able to find and remove these blockages of Qi and Blood, allowing tissues and organs to heal themselves.</p>
                    <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine treats the body as a whole. When a woman receives acupuncture care for fertility, her entire picture of health is taken into consideration. By restoring the smooth flow of Qi and Blood within the body, her general well-being will improve and she will respond better to the I.V.F. process.</p>

                <div class="fertility-research">
                    <h3>Research Findings</h3>
                    <p>Researchers from The Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY have found that acupuncture helps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce stress hormones that interfere with ovulation.</li>
                        <li>Normalize hormones that regulate ovulation so an egg is released.</li>
                        <li>Increase blood flow to the uterus, improving the chances of embryo implantation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="fertility-benefits">
                    <h3>Benefits of Acupuncture for Fertility</h3>
                    <p>Researchers determined stress to be a key factor in infertility. Acupuncture appears to reduce stress by releasing endorphins in the brain. Endorphins are chemicals that the body releases that suppress pain naturally, as well as affect hormones that influence the menstrual cycle. Acupuncture also influences levels of FSH and LH and has been found to regulate the communication between the brain and ovaries, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.</p>
                    <p>Chinese herbal remedies and acupuncture aim at promoting the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles as well as induce ovulation. When used in conjunction with IVF Chinese medicine improves the quality of follicles. Endometrial thickness and uterine artery blood flow are important for implantation of human embryos during the transfer stage of IVF. With its central effect on the nervous system, acupuncture may contribute by dilating uterine arteries and blood vessels, thereby increasing blood flow to the endometrium. With a healthy endometrial lining, chances of a stable implantation and healthy pregnancy are increased.</p>
                    <p>Acupuncture in non-toxic, affordable and is increasingly being used as a successful complement to In Vitro Fertilization.</p>

                <h2>Fibromyalgia Treatment</h2>
                
                <div class="fibromyalgia-intro">
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>At one time or another, an individual may have an ache or pain that comes and goes. Aches and pains may be caused by flu, from overuse of a muscle or even from poor posture while watching television. Sometimes, individuals may wake up feeling stiff and wondering if they may have slept in an awkward position.</p>
                    <p>There's nothing unusual about these types of pain. Yet, when pain, stiffness and aching occur constantly, it's time to contact a doctor to determine what could be causing such discomfort. It is possible that Fibromyalgia will be the diagnosis. Fibromyalgia is also known as Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS), Fibrosistis, or Chronic Muscle Pain Syndrome. If diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, it is imperative to learn as much as possible, for the more one knows, the more one will be able to keep the condition under control.</p>

                <div class="fibromyalgia-who">
                    <h3>Who Suffers From Fibromyalgia?</h3>
                    <p>Currently, millions of Americans have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Though most anyone can be diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, many more women have been diagnosed than men – and most are between the ages of 20 and 50.</p>
                    <p>There is increasing evidence Fibromyalgia can start during the teenage years. Some teenagers suffer from symptoms just as severe as their middle-age counterparts. Many individuals who experience only occasional symptoms in their youth, experience greater pain and discomfort in their later years.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fibromyalgia-treatment">
                    <h3>How Is Fibromyalgia Treated?</h3>
                    <p>Western medicine has yet to find a cure for Fibromyalgia. Doctors, to manage the symptoms prescribe medication, in the form of painkillers or anti-depressants.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the symptoms of Fibromyalgia are hard to control; hence most patients are disappointed with treatment. Fibromyalgia patients continue to suffer from additional weight gain, bloating, depression, muscle jerking, sleeplessness, and continued pain.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fibromyalgia-what">
                    <h3>What Is Fibromyalgia?</h3>
                    <p>Fibromyalgia is a form of the chronic rheumatic disorder. Like other forms of rheumatic disease, Fibromyalgia is comprised of widespread musculoskeletal pain and fatigue disorder. With Fibromyalgia, pain is centralized in the ligaments, tendons, and muscles. This affects the way joints function. Most patients with Fibromyalgia say they ache all over. Muscles may feel like they have been pulled or overworked. Sometimes, muscles twitch while at other times they burn. The severity of the symptoms will fluctuate from person to person.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fibromyalgia-causes">
                    <h3>What Causes Fibromyalgia?</h3>
                    <p>Most medical doctors are unable to pinpoint the exact cause of Fibromyalgia. It may be caused by a lack of exercise, sleep disorders, stress, or emotional trauma.</p>
                    <p>Practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine believe Fibromyalgia is caused by stagnation of blood, Qi (pronounced Chee), by the invasion of pathogenic factors of the wind, cold or dampness to the body or by nutritional imbalances.</p>
                    <p>Fibromyalgia is very similar to neurasthenia or an epidemic of the flu or cold.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fibromyalgia-symptoms">
                    <h3>Symptoms of Fibromyalgia</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Aches and Pain:</h4>
                    <p>Includes pain all over, around the joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Can be found in as many as ten to twenty spots, sensitive to the touch, located along the spine, the middle and lower back neck, shoulder arms, and legs. Fibromyalgia, and the pain associated with it, knows no boundaries. Pain can be described as deep muscular aching, burning, throbbing, shooting, or stabbing. Pain often worsens in the latter part of the day and is aggravated by cold or dampness. Fibromyalgia can also cause tension headaches.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Fatigue, Lassitude & Lack of Energy:</h4>
                    <p>Before Fibromyalgia was widely accepted, it was known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Fatigue, Lassitude and lack of energy can be mild in some patients yet incapacitating in others. Fatigue has been described as "brain fatigue" in which patients feel drained of energy.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Sleep Disorders:</h4>
                    <p>Because of pain, tiredness and other associated problems, sound sleep is often impossible. The less sleep a patient has, the worse Fibromyalgia gets.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Associated Symptoms:</h4>
                    <p>Anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, numbness or coldness of the extremities, frequent urination and weight gain are very common with Fibromyalgia.</p>

                    <h3>In Summary</h3>
                    <p>More and more Western doctors are now considering acupuncture treatment to relieve both acute and chronic lower back pain. Most acupuncturists here in the United States use a combination of acupuncture, massage, Chinese herbs (either internally administered or applied topically), Chinese diet therapy, and various types of Chinese exercise therapy. Anyone of these forms of treatment can significantly improve or even cure lower back pain.</p>

                <div class="back-pain-insight">
                    <h3>Additional Insight</h3>
                    <p>Qiu Wan-Xing, in Zhe Jiang Zhong Yi Za Zhi (Zhejiang Journal of Chinese Medicine – 1993), studied twenty patients with acute lumbar sprain with a formula first recorded in Chinese medical literature in 200 AD. Six patients were cured in 3 days; the remaining fourteen were cured in less than 6 days. When combined with other treatments, Chinese methods provide one of the best and most effective treatment protocols available in the world today.</p>

                    <h3>Can Acupuncture Help You?</h3>
                    <p>Lower back pain is one of the most common complaints. It accounts for millions of lost hours from work and even more spent on treatment and medication.</p>
                    <p>Lower back pain can either be acute (i.e. Acute lumbar sprain) or chronic (i.e. Chronic degenerative disc disease). It can be annoying or irritating or can produce unbearable physical and emotional suffering.</p>
                    <p>Acupuncture and its adjunctive therapies can indeed treat both acute and chronic back pain, including sciatica, successfully.</p>

                    <h3>Research Supports Acupuncture Treatment As Being Effective</h3>
                    <p>The following studies, conducted in China in the early 1990's, indicate the success rate of acupuncture in treatment of lower back pain.</p>
                    
                    <h4>General Findings:</h4>
                    <p>Wang Wen-Yuan et al., in Beijing Zhong Yi (Beijing Chinese Medicine – 1993), studied 5,461 patients suffering from neck, shoulder, lower back and knee pain. Patients studied ranged from 28 – 85 years old; 55% were men while 45% were women. Of these, 215 patients suffered from acute lumbar sprain while 186 patients suffered from sciatica pain. Patients were treated with acupuncture on average once per day for a total of ten treatments. In all, 76% of patients were cured and 97% of patients showed significant improvement.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Acute Lumbar Sprain Findings:</h4>
                    <p>Shu Hong-Wen, in Shang Hai Zhen Jiu Za Zhi (Shanghai Journal of Acupuncture & moxibustion – 1994), studied 129 patients (19 – 82 years old) with acute lumbar sprain. Most suffered anywhere from two hours to fifteen days, with three days being the average. Patients were treated with acupuncture needles at a single point. A control group was treated with needles at several points. Patients in BOTH groups were either cured completely or improved their condition greatly:</p>
                    
                    <div class="research-results">
                        <h5>Of those treated with the single point protocol:</h5>

                    <p>Another study done by Kan Jin-Qi et al., in Shang Hai Zhen Jiu Za Zhi (Shanghai Journal of Acupuncture and Moxibustion – 1994), further supported the success rate of the first study. Jin-Qi treated 130 patients (27 – 82 years old) with acute lower back pain. Patients suffered from a few hours to as much as seven days. Of these, 110 patients were cured in one treatment for an 85% success rate. Meanwhile, the remaining 20 patients were cured in two treatments.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Degenerative Disc Disease Findings:</h4>
                    <p>Gou Jian-Hua, reported in Jiang Su Zhong Yi (Jiangsu Chinese Medicine – 1994) that in treating 78 patients with prolapsed intervertebral discs with a combination of acupuncture, massage, heat and Acupressure:</p>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Lumbar Disc Protrusion Findings:</h4>
                    <p>Wu Shi-Qian, in, Tian Hin Zhong Yi (Tianjin Chinese Medicine – 1994), treated 50 patients (30 – 60 years old) suffering from lumbar disc protrusion with acupuncture. Patients were treated daily for ten days with 4 – 6 points per treatment for a total of one course or cycle of treatment. Patients were typically treated for three full courses or cycles of treatment.</p>

                    <p>This year, cigarette smoking will contribute to the deaths of approximately 300,000 Americans –six times the number of people who died in Vietnam in 10 years of fighting.</p>
                    <p>Cigarette smoke contains many toxic chemicals. Carbon monoxide robs the blood of oxygen leading to hypertension. Nicotine, an addictive agent, raises blood pressure. Both carbon monoxide and nicotine can lead to heart attack and stroke. Tar, which contains cancer-causing chemicals, builds up in lung tissue.</p>
                    <p>Strokes and fatal heart attacks are far more likely to occur with smokers than with nonsmokers</p>

                    <h4>What is Obesity?</h4>
                    <p>The most common and avoidable health problem in America today is obesity. In the U.S, one in every four adults is obese. Recently, Science Magazine noted Americans weight 30% more than their ideal weight. Unfortunately, obesity is reaching children and young adults in increasing numbers. Obesity is more than looking bad; it is a disease that can cause significant health problems.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Obesity And Your Health</h4>
                    <p>The body's normal digestion, metabolism and hormonal activities are seriously damaged with weight gain. Obesity may be caused by side effects to prescribed medication, mental and physical illness, aging or lifestyle (eating the wrong foods at the wrong time, lack of exercise or improper digestion). Poor diet (excessive sweets, greasy foods, and red meat) diminishes the function of the digestive system to cleanse the body of toxins, which can lead to body intoxication. Long term effects can lead to a loss of interest in work, moodiness, irritability, nervousness, bad breath, body odor, coated tongue, sleep disorder, headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, angiosperms (cold hands and/or feet), exhaustion and heavy sweat. Other problems due to obesity are additional fat-related disease, poor posture, and premature death.</p>
                    <p>Acupuncture, auriculotherapy (ear acupuncture), and herbal medicine are the best defense in treating obesity and normalizing the body's functions. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, obesity is due to a deficiency of bio-energy and dampness of the spleen and stomach. By adhering to the program, patients will not experience the traditional "yo-yo" syndrome and will continue to lose weight.</p>

                    <h4>2. Treatment:</h4>
                    <p>Electroacupuncture, auriculotherapy, and massage therapies are essential. Nutritional supplements, including herbs, are prescribed to assist in losing weight and improving a patient's general health.</p>

                    <p>Patients must begin a light exercise program consisting of moderate activity at least three times per week (i.e. brisk walk, bike ride, recreational sports, aerobic dance, etc.). Relaxation is the key to success. Physical activity should become a part of a patient's everyday life.</p>
